# TDD-Project-Solver
In this project we will implement a class with some methods, but we will do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). The main idea is to write tests first and then the code.

## Project Requirements

- Create a class called `Solver`.

- Create a method called `factorial` that takes one argument, an integer `N`, and returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to `N` and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.

- Create a method called `reverse` that takes one argument, a string `word`, and returns `word` reversed (e.g. if `word` is `"hello"` it returns `"olleh"`).

- Create a method called `fizzbuzz` that takes one argument, an integer `N`, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
 - When `N` is divisible by 3, return `"fizz"`.
 - When `N` is divisible by 5, return `"buzz"`.
 - When `N` is divisible by 3 and 5, return `"fizzbuzz"`.
 - Any other case, return `N` as a string (e.g. say `N` is `7` then return `"7"`).
- Remember to start with tests for all of the methods described above. Your commit history should prove that you have used TDD.
